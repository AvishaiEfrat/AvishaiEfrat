### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
1. I'm a senior security researcher specializing in AI and low-code/no-code security at Zenity, and enthusiastic about all aspects of security.
2. My current work is focusing on identifying vulnerabilities in organizations' Copilot M365, CoPilot Studio bots, and GenAI deployments and my experience spans across web security, anti-bot protection, OSINT, blockchain, and data engineering.
3. I'm one of the main contributors of [PowerPwn](https://github.com/mbrg/power-pwn), using [this](https://github.com/AvishaiEZen) user too (supporting an OS security tool has always been a dream of mine).
4. I also contribute to the GenAI attack matrix at [ttps.ai](https://ttps.ai) (some of it has also been added to [MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/matrices/ATLAS)).
5. I've previously presented at BSidesTLV, Black Hat USA Arsenal and SecTor.
